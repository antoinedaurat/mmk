# Music Modelling Toolkit (MMK)

MMK is a library of generative models for audio and music data. 
It allows you to have some deep-learning fun *with your own data* even if you only have very little resources.

The `notebooks/` can be used in google colab to train models and generate sounds with them. Try it out and have fun!
